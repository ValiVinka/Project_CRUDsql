The subject of this website was to see if your PC is capable of running properly for the intended purposes (casual, gaming, heavy gaming/workloads).

In the upgrade section we can see some tips on the most important components in a PC and how to pick them

At the bottom of the page, I've placed a little tutorial on how to find your system specs, and a little calculator to see if your system is good enough for its use.
